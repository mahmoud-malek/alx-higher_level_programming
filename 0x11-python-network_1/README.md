### 0x11. Python - Network #1

#### Project Overview
This project focuses on developing foundational skills in Python for network-related tasks. It covers topics such as fetching internet resources, handling HTTP requests, and working with JSON data.

#### Learning Objectives
Upon completing this project, you should be able to:

- Use the Python package urllib for fetching internet resources.
- Decode urllib body responses.
- Make HTTP GET requests.
- Make various HTTP requests (POST/PUT/etc.).
- Fetch and manipulate JSON resources.

#### Copyright and Plagiarism
It's crucial to develop solutions independently for each task to meet the learning objectives. Any form of plagiarism is strictly prohibited and may result in removal from the program.

### Requirements

- Allowed Editors: vi, vim, emacs
- Interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using Python 3 (version 3.8.5)
- Files should end with a new line
- The first line of all files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`
- A `README.md` file at the root of the repo is mandatory, containing a description of the repository
- Your code should use pycodestyle (version 2.8.*)
- All files must be executable
- The length of your files will be tested using wc
- All modules should have documentation (use `python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)'`)
- Use 'get' to access dictionary values by key
- Documentation should be descriptive, not just a word (length will be verified)
- Code should not be executed when imported (use `if __name__ == "__main__":`)
