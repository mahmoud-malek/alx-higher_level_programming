# 0x0C. Python - Almost a circle

This project focuses on Python and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). It entails the creation of classes, inheritance, unit testing, and JSON manipulation. The project will help prepare for more complex tasks in the Higher level curriculum.

## Background Context

The AirBnB project is a significant part of the Higher level curriculum. This project serves as preparation for it. Here's an overview of the project requirements:

### Learning Objectives

The goal is to cover a range of Python concepts, including:
- Import, Exceptions, Class, Private attributes
- Getter/Setter, Class method, Static method
- Inheritance, Unittest, Read/Write file
- args and kwargs, Serialization/Deserialization, JSON

### Requirements

- Python Scripts: Use editors vi, vim, emacs.
- All files interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5).
- `README.md` file at the root of the project folder.
- Code should follow PEP8 style and use `pycodestyle` (version 2.8.*).
- All files should end with a newline and start with `#!/usr/bin/python3`.
- Document all modules, classes, and functions adequately.
- Unit tests should be written using the `unittest` module and organized correctly.

## Tasks

The project is broken down into several tasks, including:
1. Base class: Implementing the base class with specific functionalities.
2. First Rectangle: Creating a class Rectangle with validations.
3. Validate attributes: Adding validation to Rectangle attributes.
4. Area first: Implementing a method to calculate the area.
5. Display #0: Creating a display method.
6. __str__: Overriding the `__str__` method.
7. Display #1: Enhancing the display method considering x and y.
8. Update #0: Adding an `update` method for the Rectangle class.
9. Update #1: Improving the `update` method to handle keyword arguments.
10. And now, the Square!: Building the Square class inheriting from Rectangle.
11. Square size: Adding getter and setter for size in the Square class.
12. Square update: Implementing an `update` method for the Square class.
13. Rectangle instance to dictionary representation: Creating a method to convert a Rectangle instance to a dictionary.
14. Square instance to dictionary representation: Developing a method to convert a Square instance to a dictionary.
15. Dictionary to JSON string: Creating a method to convert a list of dictionaries to a JSON string.
16. JSON string to file: Implementing a method to save JSON string representation to a file.
17. JSON string to dictionary: Method to convert a JSON string to a list of dictionaries.
18. Dictionary to Instance: Method to create an instance from a dictionary.
19. File to instances: Method to load instances from a file.
